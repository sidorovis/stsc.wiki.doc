Welcome to the stsc wiki!

Stsc is a bunch of tools to create algorithmic trading strategies. This is a complicated system that require you to be familiar with several topics in algorithm trading.

Workflow for generating algorithmic strategies includes next phases:
1. Creation of hypothesis. 
2. Algorithm code realization (probably you will use already created base);
3. Algorithm tuning with possiblity to distribute and paralellise that process (using hadoop calculation cluster) (probably spark or whatever in future);
4. Algorithm testing.
